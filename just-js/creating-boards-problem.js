// Problem statement #
//
// The game designer gives you three arguments: length, width, and pieces. Each argument is as follows:
//
// length (First argument): This is the length of the outer array of the two-dimensional array representation of the board.
// width (Second argument): This is the length of the inner arrays of the two-dimensional array representation of the board.
// pieces (Third argument): This is an array of objects where each object has the following properties:
// row: Has a number value representing the index of the outer array of two-dimensional array representations of the board.
// col: Has a number value representing the index of the inner array of two-dimensional array representations of the board.
// value: Is the string value representing the piece that will be assigned to the respective index inside the two-dimensional array representation of the board.
//
// Create a two-dimensional array of the respective length and width and populate it with the piecesâ€™ values of the objects residing in the array, passed to the third (pieces) argument. All unpopulated indices will be assigned to " " value (a string with only a single space character).
//
// NOTE: Make sure to ignore the objects with an out of bounds index in the array of pieces.

const generate = function (length, width, pieces) {
  // Create array of size length  and fill with " " using fill method
  let board = new Array(length).fill(" ");
  // Assign array at each index to a new array of size width and fill with " "
  board = board.map((_) => new Array(width).fill(" "));

  // Populate the board through forEach method on pieces array
  pieces.forEach((piece) => {
    // Create check for out of bounds
    // If out of bounds, return
    if (piece["row"] >= length || piece["col"] >= width) return;
    if (piece["row"] < 0 || piece["col"] < 0) return;
    // The piece is not out of bounds and so it is assigned to the board
    board[piece["row"]][piece["col"]] = piece["value"];
  });
  return board;
};
// Create a list of objects which represent pieces to be added in board
// Note that the last piece is incorrect
